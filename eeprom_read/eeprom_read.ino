    Larger AVR processors have larger EEPROM sizes, E.g:
    - Arduno Duemilanove: 512b EEPROM storage.
    - Arduino Uno:        1kb EEPROM storage.
    - Arduino Mega:       4kb EEPROM storage.

    Rather than hard-coding the length, you should use the pre-provided length function.
    This will make your code portable to all AVR processors.
